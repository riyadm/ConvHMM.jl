# ConvHMM.jl
Implementation of Convolved HMM (Markov-Switching Gaussian Process) described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06613). Check my [Master's thesis](https://purl.stanford.edu/km001pf4033) for examples of application to seismic inverse problem.

## Installation
Get the latest stable Julia binaries [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/). If you are new to Julia, I suggest installing the [JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) distribution. Currently, the package can be installed through Julia's package manager:
```julia
]add https://github.com/riyadm/ConvHMM.jl
